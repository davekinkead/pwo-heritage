# Richard Innes Peek

Richard Peek, nicknamed ‘Peter’ as a junior officer onboard HMAS Canberra, joined the RAN in 1928.  After graduation from the RAN College he spent the next few years at sea and ashore in both Australia and the United Kingdom, developing and honing his seamanship and warfare officer skills.  Electing gunnery as his chosen warfare specialisation, he received his “Long G” qualification in the UK in 1939.

Lieutenant Peek was appointed to the cruiser HMAS Hobart as the Gunnery Officer in May 1941, and saw active service in the Mediterranean in support of operations in the Western Desert and Syria.  When Hobart was recalled to Australia after Japan entered the war, Peek ensured that the cruiser retained its additional light anti-aircraft weapons, even though it was contrary to Mediterranean Standing Orders for ships departing the area of operations to do so. These measures stood the ship in good stead during repeated air attacks throughout subsequent operations in Singapore and Java.  Hobart also saw action in the Battle of the Coral Sea in May 1942, where she succeeded in shooting down two Japanese aircraft.  Peek saw further wartime service as the Gunnery Officer in the flagship HMAS Australia, which was deployed as an integral part of the Allied Forces during the campaign to liberate the Philippines from the Japanese. He was awarded the Order of the British Empire and Distinguished Service Cross in recognition of his service during this hard fought campaign.

At the end of the war, Lieutenant Commander Peek led the RAN contingent at the Victory celebrations in London.  It was during this time that personal tragedy struck.  While in the UK as a member of the 1946 Royal Navy Staff Course, Lieutenant Commander Peek’s wife died during childbirth in Australia.  Being separated from his new-born son left a long-standing drive in him to support and fight for the rights of naval personnel. This was further strengthened later in his career during his time as the commanding officer of the destroyer Tobruk when a sailor was killed during a fleet exercise. He considered that the welfare of sailors and access to appropriate benefits was paramount to the effectiveness of the RAN.  

Further sea service included commands in HMA Ships Shoalhaven, Bataan and Tobruk, the latter during active service in the Korean War between 1951 and 1952.  During that time, Tobruk successfully destroyed a complete Communist freight train, for which Peek received the US Legion of Merit.  On promotion to Captain, he returned to Tobruk in 1956-57. He also saw action in the Far East Strategic Reserve during the Malayan Emergency.
Senior appointments followed, including command of both of RAN aircraft carriers, HMA Ships Sydney and Melbourne. He was made a Companion of the Bath in 1971 and a Knight Commander of the British Empire the following year. Vice Admiral Peek retired from the RAN as Chief of Naval Staff in 1973, having played an integral role in the development of a joint Defence department.  In retirement he actively continued as an advocate for the welfare of officers and sailors of the RAN. 
His leadership and courage in battle, along with his notable warfare skills, made Richard Peek a first class gunnery officer, one the Navy’s most gifted destroyer captains and he was an inspiration to his subordinates.  He had high standards and demanded the same from others, including fighting for high standards from Navy in their duty of care to all.

## COURAGE UNDER FIRE 

On 21 October 1944, HMAS Australia became the first ship to be attacked by Japanese kamikaze aircraft during the Battle of Leyte Gulf.  

That morning, Australia had weighed anchor and was preparing to provide fire support for the forces ashore.  Lieutenant Commander Peek’s action station was on the bridge with Captain Emile Dechaineux, when a Japanese Val dive bomber was detected approaching the fleet from ashore.  LCDR Peek reportedly called out to the Captain, “Just look at this.  She’s aiming for us.”  

In Peek’s words:

> "It was a complete surprise when I saw an enemy aircraft fly across our stern, bank, then fly from our port quarter, apparently aiming at our bridge.  I called to our captain, who came over to the port side of the compass platform. We watched the kamikaze strike our tripod foremast; debris and flames, apparently from the petrol, covered the whole of the upper bridge." 
>
> "My next memory was of visiting our mortally wounded captain and telling him that everything was under control.”

Australia sustained severe damage in this attack; the aircraft’s petrol tanks had exploded, dousing those on the bridge and causing major fires. Along with Captain Dechaineux, 30 other sailors and officers were killed. A further 64 were injured, including Lieutenant Commander Peek, who remained on duty although badly burnt.  For “skill, determination and courage” he was appointed an Officer of the British Empire in the Military Division.  

Australia was subsequently withdrawn to effect repairs and restore her warfighting capabilities.  Peek played a major role in getting Australia ready before rejoining the task group in January 1945 in time for the landings in Lingayen Gulf.  Australia was again subjected to kamikaze attacks, suffering four direct hits and one near miss over the space of 4 days.  Despite damage and casualties amounting to 44 dead and 69 wounded, the cruiser remained on task, supporting the assaults with effective bombardment and counter battery fire. During this time Peek was forced to reorganise his depleted gun crews and improvise new control arrangements in order to guarantee that Australia met her assigned tasking. 

Although still recuperating from injuries received in the initial kamikaze attack of 21 October 1944, Lieutenant Commander Peek’s energy and determination were evident, and he rose to the challenge of leadership in battle.  His ‘skill, gallantry and devotion to duty’ was recognised with the award of a Distinguished Service Cross in May 1945.
