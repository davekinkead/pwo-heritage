# Frederick Meares Osborne

Frederick Osborne was born in Orange, NSW, and after graduating with a law degree from the University of Sydney, was admitted as a solicitor of the Supreme Court of NSW in 1934.  In 1938 he joined the Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve (RANVR) and trained at the anti-submarine school HMAS Penguin.
  
In March 1940, SBLT Osborne was posted to the RN anti-submarine trawler HMS St Loman, nicknamed the Fighting Saint.  Immediately on joining, St Loman deployed to the Battle of Norway, to assist in the evacuation of British and French troops from Namsos, where 5400 troops were evacuated under sustained attack.  For his devotion to duty and bravery during this operation, SBLT Osborne was awarded the DSC.

In September 1940 LEUT Osborne was promoted and posted to the corvette HMS Gentian as First Lieutenant, and after being reported on as an ‘above average anti-submarine officer’, he took command in October 1941.  He remained in command of Gentian until February 1943, the longest command during Gentian’s war service.

During two and a half years in Gentian, he crossed the Atlantic on escort duties 22 times as part of the Battle of the Atlantic.  Gentian came under numerous sustained attacks from the air and U-boats.  More of a concern at times was the weather in the Atlantic, with gale force seas and winds and sub-zero temperatures.

In November 1943, Acting Lieutenant Commander Osborne posted as the Commanding Officer of the destroyer HMS Vanquisher (D54), the first RANVR officer to command an RN destroyer, and later commanded the Black Swan class Sloop HMS Peacock.

Frederick Osborne returned to Australia and became the Federal Member for Evans from 1949 until 1961.  Although a member of parliament and a Cabinet Minister, he considered that “commanding the destroyer Vanquisher was much the greater job”.  He served his country in a brave and distinguished manner.

# DISTINGUISHED SERVICE

Acting Lieutenant Commander Osborne assumed command of Vanquisher in October 1943, during her deployment to the Atlantic on convoy defence duties with Convoy ON206.  Convoy escorts were constantly under the threat of submarine attack, with many engagements claiming merchant vessels as well as some escorts.  Vanquisher and her crew were continually at a high state of readiness, and it was up to Osborne as Commanding Officer, to keep his ship operating at maximum effectiveness and efficiency.

In May 1944, Vanquisher was assigned as part of Operation Neptune, the assault phase of the Allied invasion of Normandy.  She was assigned to Escort Group 106 with one frigate, four corvettes, motor launches and two trawlers.  On 4 June, the group rendezvoused in the Irish Sea with assault convoy EMB3, consisting of 11 empty motor transport ships.  Following loading of the transports at ports on the south coast of England, the convoy made passage to the beachhead, arriving at the invasion beaches and discharging their cargo on 8 June.

Vanquisher then began escort of convoys carrying reinforcements and supplies from Falmouth to the beachhead, until Operation Neptune concluded late June.  Vanquisher was again attached to the 6th Escort Group escorting North Atlantic convoys.

In April 1945, Vanquisher was part of the escort for Convoy ONA 265, and on 10 April with the corvette HMAS Tintagel Castle, conducted a depth charge attack that sank the German submarine U-878 in the Bay of Biscay. 

Acting Lieutenant Commander Osborne was awarded a bar to his DSC for devotion to duty , consistently showing a high level of professionalism and distinguished service.
