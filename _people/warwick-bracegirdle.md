# Warwick Seymour Bracegirdle

Warwick ‘Braces’ Bracegirdle followed in the footsteps of his father, Rear Admiral Sir Leighton Bracegirdle, joining the RAN in 1925 through the RAN College. He graduated in 1928 having being awarded the King’s Medal for displaying outstanding officer-like qualities. His first ship was the cruiser HMAS Australia and on proceeding to the United Kingdom in 1930 he served in the battleship HMS Ramillies. 

During the early years of World War II, Lieutenant Bracegirdle was posted as the Gunnery Officer in the cruiser HMAS Perth, operating in the Mediterranean waters around Greece, Crete and Syria.  Perth often came under air attack, and it was the responsibility of Bracegirdle to keep his warfare team calm and ready for battle in any circumstance.  At Piraeus, near Athens, he was almost killed when the ammunition ship Clan Fraser exploded while he was trying to tow a lighter clear during an air raid. For “his personal courage and determination” in Perth, Bracegirdle was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC).

After a brief stint instructing at the Gunnery School at Flinders Naval Depot and on promotion to Lieutenant Commander, Bracegirdle was selected to be the commissioning Gunnery Officer of the cruiser HMAS Shropshire.  He hand-picked his gunnery team, and after bringing Shropshire back from the UK, was deployed continually in the Pacific throughout the remainder of WWII. 

In Bracegirdle’s words: “all the way up the New Guinea north coast (2000 miles) to Halmaheras, we took part in nearly every landing and bombardment including Leyte Gulf night action and the Lingayen Gulf landings and Corregidor. Experiencing bombardments, kamikaze attacks, night actions and all in the very terrible heat and humidity of the tropical Philippines. To do all this, and not lose a man, means a spirit, discipline and teamwork that is quite exceptional.”  

Known as ‘a cool thinker in action’, he received a bar to his DSC for his ‘gallantry and skill’ at Leyte Gulf in October 1944.

In the rank of Commander, Bracegirdle commanded HMAS Bataan during the Korean War and in 1952 was awarded a further bar to his DSC and the US Legion of Merit. He retired from the RAN in 1957. 

# INSPIRATIONAL LEADERSHIP

As Gunnery Officer of HMAS Shropshire, Lieutenant Commander Bracegirdle led his gunnery team through many actions of significance, including both the Battles of Leyte and Lingayen Gulf.  Throughout, Shropshire was a key participant, remaining closed up at action stations for lengthy periods of time and firing with a high rate of success.  This excellent performance was no accident.  In the weeks leading up to the Leyte Gulf landings on 20 October 1944, Bracegirdle had put Shropshire through extensive drills and practise shoots, ensuring that not only was the equipment calibrated to the best possible degree, but also that his men had confidence in themselves and each other.  However, even before action commenced, Bracegirdle’s leadership was put to the test.  

During the morning watch before the Leyte Gulf landings, Bracegirdle was the Principal Control Officer on watch in Shropshire, in company with troop ships, troop transports and landing craft following astern.  All the ships were travelling at slow speed with their paravanes streamed, as they sailed towards their bombardment positions for the landings.  It was during this quiet transit that Shropshire’s port lookout spotted a Japanese mine, carrying between 500-1000 pounds of explosive, caught in a paravane, bobbing about 20 feet from the port side just below the bridge..  By keeping his crew calm through the remainder of his watch before successfully slipping and sinking the mine with small arms fire, Lieutenant Commander Bracegirdle showed courage and confidence that was both inspirational and contagious.

Throughout the days that followed, Shropshire responded to all tasking with distinction, her crew showing great resolve and stamina.  As part of the American formation, Shropshire was often required to operate at the limitations of her radar range, which was not ideal for target control.  Nevertheless, the combination of leadership and experience within the gunnery team resulted in Shropshire consistently fulfilling her responsibilities and her assigned tasks.  

The highlight for Bracegirdle was the night Battle of Surigao Strait when Shropshire was part of Rear Admiral Oldendorf's force (Task Force 77) that engaged a Japanese battle squadron.  While closing in formation with the two American cruisers Phoenix and Boise, under fire of torpedoes and manoeuvring constantly in the face of the Japanese battle fleet, Bracegirdle’s exhausted team managed to continually fire Shropshire’s guns to give a total of 32 broadsides over the thirteen minute engagement.  At one stage, Shropshire achieved the highest rate of fire possible for 8” gun turrets – 8 broadsides fired in two minutes.  In this decisive Allied victory Shropshire became the only RAN ship to engage an enemy battleship when she engaged the Yamashiro.

It was later recorded “Hardly a word was spoken on the bridge during the action except for course alterations but when the radar spotter in the TS (Transmitting Station) reported broadside No 3 scored a hit on the enemy's bridge he saw in the glare of an explosion behind it, the Yamashiro's high pagoda-like structure silhouetted. He ordered all guns to fire rapid broadsides at the enemy ship - a devastating victory for us all.” 

Lieutenant Commander Bracegirdle was a man trusted implicitly by both his superiors and subordinates, and was able to maintain a calm presence in the face of potential danger.  His ability to inspire his warfare team made him an exceptional leader, a trait extremely valuable in a gunnery officer in battle.
