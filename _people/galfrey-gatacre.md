# Galfrey George Ormond Gatacre 

Galfrey Gatacre, or ‘Gats’, was the son of a farmer.  Born in Wooroolin, Queensland, he joined the RAN in 1921 after being inspired to naval service by his godfather, Admiral Sir Reginald Tupper, RN.  After graduating from the Royal Australian Naval College in 1924, he served in both Australian and British ships before completing specialist navigation training in the UK in 1937.  He also found the time to play first class cricket, representing the RN in 1928.

As a Lieutenant Commander, Gatacre spent the early part of World War II navigating some of the RN’s most well known ships – the cruiser HMS Edinburgh, the 15-inch gun battlecruiser HMS Renown and the 16-inch gun battleships, Nelson and Rodney. He demonstrated a remarkable capacity for long hours and hard work in these demanding and challenging roles.  In October 1941, as Navigator of Rodney, Gatacre was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) for ‘mastery, determination and skill in action against the German battleship Bismarck’.  

On promotion to Commander in 1942, Gatacre was posted as the Staff Officer (Operations and Intelligence) to the Commander of the Australian Squadron embarked in the cruiser HMAS Australia.  Over the next two years, he participated in many operations in the South-West Pacific theatre, including the battles of Savo Island and the Eastern Solomons. He also took part in the amphibious landings along the New Guinea coastline, and for his ‘skill, resolution and coolness’ in the Solomon Islands campaign he was awarded a bar to his DSC.  In August 1944 he was given his first shore posting after eleven years of marriage and over twenty years service in the RAN. 

Post-war sea commands included the destroyer HMAS Arunta, in operations throughout Asia and the destroyer HMAS Anzac during the Korean War, for which he was awarded a Distinguished Service Order. He later commanded the RAN Flagship HMAS Melbourne. 

Gatacre’s final appointment was Flag Officer-in-Charge, East Australia Area.  Rear Admiral Gatacre retired from the Navy in 1964, following a distinguished career which highlighted his professional skills and capacity for clear thought in battle.  His intelligence and situational awareness made him a highly respected and valuable component of any warfare team, in any capacity. He recorded his career in his memoirs Report of Proceedings.


# PROFESSIONAL FORTITUDE

Lieutenant Commander Gatacre was the Navigator in HMS Rodney in May 1941, under the Command of Captain F.H.G. Dalrymple-Hamilton, RN. As part of the British Home Fleet, Rodney took part in the pursuit of the German battleship Bismarck which, in company with the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen, had broken out into the North Atlantic, sinking the pride of the British fleet, the battlecruiser HMS Hood and severely damaging the new battleship HMS Prince of Wales.

Throughout three days of searching for, locating, engaging and then again losing sight of the German ships, Lieutenant Commander Gatacre maintained vigilant navigational awareness, of not only the whereabouts of his own Fleet, but also the possible location and movements of the Bismarck.  He remained with his captain on the compass platform throughout the pursuit, and put much thought into interpreting the developing battle.
 
On 25 May, an incorrect plotting of Bismarck’s position onboard HMS King George V resulted in the Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Tovey, ordering the British Fleet to steer to the north-east, on the assumption that Bismarck was returning to Germany.  Onboard Rodney, which was yet to rendezvous with King George V, Gatacre’s plotting of Bismarck and his instincts told him otherwise.  He was convinced that Bismarck was heading in a southerly direction towards the French port of Brest. 

In Gatacre’s words: “Always obey the last order! A basic rule in military command.  We chose to partly obey!!”

Captain Dalrymple-Hamilton decided to trust his Navigator, and consequently a course was calculated and followed to intercept Bismarck.  Soon after ADM Tovey realised an error had been made and ordered the British Fleet towards Brest, and signalled words to the effect that Gatacre could congratulate himself for being right all along!

“In Rodney we breathed a sigh of relief – we had done the right thing – although somewhat prematurely!” Rodney subsequently rendezvoused with King George V on 26 May, taking her place on the stage at the time she was most needed.

On the morning of 27 May, King George V and Rodney engaged Bismarck.  With Gatacre at the con, Rodney closed continually throughout the two hour engagement, until she was firing a flat trajectory from all guns.  Accurate fire control delivered a vital blow to Bismarck’s forward turrets early in the action with blast and shell splinters sweeping her bridge, killing almost everyone there. Gatacre’s careful manoeuvring, in the midst of battle and with dwindling fuel supplies, ensured that Rodney was best positioned for constant close range fire, firing nearly 1100 shells in total.  On departure due to low fuel, Rodney fired its final two 24” torpedoes, with one actually hitting Bismarck, believed to be the only time in history a battleship successfully torpedoed another in battle.  Further torpedo fire from the cruiser HMS Dorsetshire was the final blow, with Bismarck sinking at 1040.
 For mastery, determination and skill in action, Lieutenant Commander Gatacre was awarded a Distinguished Service Cross.
